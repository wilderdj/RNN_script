# RNN_script
A Recurrent Neural Network to generate a new script based off previous data.
Insert your file location into the "textfile =" variable. Make sure your file is a .txt and has a decent amount of words for the model to read. Think of at least an entire episode of a show or an entire play at least. The more words, the better.
To increase the accuracy of the model, increase the epochs in the "history =" in one of the last peices of code. This will cause the model to run longer but will give more of a readable script. You will have to walk away and let it run.
